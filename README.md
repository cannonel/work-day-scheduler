# work-day-scheduler

## Purpose
A weekday planner, featuring the common 9-5 workday hours, allowing you to save daily tasks that persist on your webpage. This app includes a real-time clock, meaning you can create and save tasks for your day and the time-block color that spans across the text will indicate the current, future, and past hours of the day. Ultimately, this app features a user-friendly interface with bright, color coded task windows to ensure timely executions of day-to-day tasks! And tasks save after a page refresh, too.
